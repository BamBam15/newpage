<h1>This is About me</h1>
<p>I grew up being the male chhild of my Family of 4. In Africa, you have to make something of yourself as a man and being the only son has imposed kind of pressure on me from birth and the only woman i ever loved which is my Mom was taken from me at a tender age,and Dad suffered a stroke two years later which left my family broken and being the only one with him. Had to be the one taking care of him until he was able to gain his movements back. He sacrificed a lot for me but I was young and did not understand how life works then, Sold his car so we could eat and I could get a quality Education but what did I do at the first contact of freedom, Go Rogue. Tried to fill up the void left in me during my early teenage years, had no mentors to keep me in line. Every one I encontered supported in my wayward lifestyle and it destroyed me. Now i have clarity of how life works and wished I could take those moments back but its all gone and all I could hope for is to make it by working extra hard to make something of myself. I have limited opportunies and I hope this web development I am venturing make returns. I am ready to sacrifice everything I have into this and I pray it yields great results.</p>
